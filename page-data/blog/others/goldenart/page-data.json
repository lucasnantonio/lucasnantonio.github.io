It uses Airtable as the CMS, where the client can update the products’ information and actually became the source of truth for the company’s inventory. It was a steep learning curve and got me a decent understanding of Javascript, Node, and Express.</p>\n<div class=\"w-100 bg-washed-red pa4 tc\">\n  <video class=\"w-100 mw6 br2\" autoplay loop>\n  <source src=\"/golden-art-1-b79dc76db387020f0d359e45611f6183.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n  </video>\n</div>\n<p>One of the customer’s biggest problems was picking a color finish from the catalogue. To this date, the company did not have a way to accurately represent all the colors available. We tried scanning and photographing the materials, but the best results came from 3D renderings. I had fun experimenting with Vectary, a browser-based 3D tool, to produce the images below:</p>\n<div class=\"w-100 bg-washed-red pa4 tc\">\n  <video class=\"w-100 mw6 br2\" autoplay loop>\n  <source src=\"/golden-art-2-c49120a8a9891c7ea0e42bb6db0bf4dc.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n  </video>\n</div>\n<h2>Problems with the old version</h2>\n<p>The client and I walked through the old website together and listed main issues that needed a fix. Visually, they felt like the website was too dark, and that functionally it was clunky, had many bugs, and was hard to maintain and update. The product pages opened in a lightbox, which made it difficult for users to save and share specific pages. Also, the website was not responsive, which increased a high mobile bounce rate.</p>\n<figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 1800px;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 92.62726740784083%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"The old website\"\n        title=\"The old website\"\n        src=\"/static/8148c38da6662213602f49190890910a/79a4a/goldenart-006.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8148c38da6662213602f49190890910a/44727/goldenart-006.png 450w,\n/static/8148c38da6662213602f49190890910a/fea0e/goldenart-006.png 900w,\n/static/8148c38da6662213602f49190890910a/79a4a/goldenart-006.png 1800w,\n/static/8148c38da6662213602f49190890910a/b6e30/goldenart-006.png 2700w,\n/static/8148c38da6662213602f49190890910a/b41e4/goldenart-006.png 3418w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">The old website</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<ol>\n<li>We found various legibility problems with the colors used in some fields.</li>\n<li>Submenus and links were added with time on top of the original structure, which created a very questionable information architecture.</li>\n<li>The main banner was a static image with flattened text, which was hard to update and read on mobile.</li>\n<li>The bottom menu was fixed, which occupied too much real estate.</li>\n<li>The client had little control over the order in which the products were displayed.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>CMS architecture and backend</h2>\n<p>GoldenArt has over 500 products in their catalog. The old Wordpress website was painful because it required the company to keep the CMS up-to-date with their in-house catalog system, which was an Excel spreadsheet. In researching solutions to this problem, I found Airtable, and the client and I fell in love with it.</p>\n<figure>\n<div class=\"w-100 bg-washed-red pa4 tc\">\n<img src=\"/goldenart-010-797b4c76d1b0dcaffc8e5c28b9208b8f.gif\">\n</div></figure>\n<figcaption>The product database, built on Airtable</figcaption>\n\n<p>It is a very friendly platform, and it became the internal source of truth for all the information about the product lines, which gets shared with their partners and clients. As they change the info on Airtable, the website is updated in real-time.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The new website has a much more coherent structure, with products divided by line and type. This makes it easier for a user, such as an architect, to find the kind of product they’re looking for. It’s easier for the client to add and change details about each product, attach technical drawings and 3D files, and now each product has dedicated shareable page.</p>\n<p>To me, this was a challenging and fulfilling side project that quickly elevated my knowledge of web design and development. After working long hours to ship the website and after the multiple times I accidentally took it down, I’m now much more comfortable having technical discussions with folks in the product teams at work.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 04, 2019","path":"/blog/others/goldenart","title":"GoldenArt","topics":["Product Design","Code"],"subtitle":"My family's company website, my code sandbox.","problem":"Old, unmaintained Wordpress website with no flexibility for current content","solution":"Website redesigned and rebuilt from scratch using Node.js","impact":"Higher customer engagement and satisfaction, better usability & better client control over content","color":"pink","where":"São Paulo","design_team":["Lucas Neumann"],"learn_more":"http://goldenart.com.br","team":null,"myrole":"CMS Information Architecture, Design and Code (Javascript, Node)","link":"http://www.goldenart.com.br","cover_image":{"publicURL":"/static/golden-art-hero-2-181483404ea55acba4d3d44ac4836e09.png","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/181483404ea55acba4d3d44ac4836e09/54c56/golden-art-hero-2.png","srcSet":"/static/181483404ea55acba4d3d44ac4836e09/16256/golden-art-hero-2.png 175w,\n/static/181483404ea55acba4d3d44ac4836e09/73897/golden-art-hero-2.png 350w,\n/static/181483404ea55acba4d3d44ac4836e09/54c56/golden-art-hero-2.png 700w,\n/static/181483404ea55acba4d3d44ac4836e09/c0798/golden-art-hero-2.png 1050w,\n/static/181483404ea55acba4d3d44ac4836e09/cd9a9/golden-art-hero-2.png 1400w,\n/static/181483404ea55acba4d3d44ac4836e09/155f2/golden-art-hero-2.png 6400w","sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/nubank/nuconta","title":"Nubank Savings","subtitle":"Designing the largest digital banking app in the world"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/automatic-research-recruiting","title":"Automated User Research Recruiting","subtitle":"Talking to users every week"}}}}}
