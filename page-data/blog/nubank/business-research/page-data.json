Because of the report, it became clear that the first product (the one where customers had the biggest pains and or technology was better positioned to help) was indeed a banking account, and not a POS or finance management tool, like we had thought at the beginning of the project.</p>\n<p>I left Nubank before the public release of this product, but managed the team of designers and researchers involved in it until the alpha program was live.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 01, 2018","path":"/blog/nubank/business-research","title":"Nubank for Business","topics":["Research"],"subtitle":"Foundational Research","problem":"How to start expanding into the business banking space?","solution":"Month-long field research project involving 40+ business owners of various profiles.","impact":"Initial strategy for a whole new vertical in Nubank's products.","color":"BlueViolet","where":"São Paulo","design_team":null,"learn_more":null,"team":["Lucas Limão","Ricardo Sato","Rachel Jordan","Gabriela Rojas"],"cover_image":{"publicURL":"/static/nubank-merchants-d2252b4aae4f5ad493769c6b50e3d3dd.png","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/d2252b4aae4f5ad493769c6b50e3d3dd/54c56/nubank-merchants.png","srcSet":"/static/d2252b4aae4f5ad493769c6b50e3d3dd/16256/nubank-merchants.png 175w,\n/static/d2252b4aae4f5ad493769c6b50e3d3dd/73897/nubank-merchants.png 350w,\n/static/d2252b4aae4f5ad493769c6b50e3d3dd/54c56/nubank-merchants.png 700w,\n/static/d2252b4aae4f5ad493769c6b50e3d3dd/c0798/nubank-merchants.png 1050w,\n/static/d2252b4aae4f5ad493769c6b50e3d3dd/cd9a9/nubank-merchants.png 1400w,\n/static/d2252b4aae4f5ad493769c6b50e3d3dd/155f2/nubank-merchants.png 6400w","sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":null,"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/others/goldenart","title":"GoldenArt Online Catalogue","subtitle":"A 30-year-old company's web catalog"}}}}}
