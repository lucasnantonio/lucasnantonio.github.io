This isn’t always easy with the spread of misleading information online. Birdwatch is a community-driven approach to addressing this problem, seeking to create a better-informed world.</p>\n<p>Birdwatch participants can identify Tweets they believe are misleading, write notes that provide context on the Tweet, and rate the quality of other participants’ notes. Through consensus from a broad and diverse set of contributors, our eventual goal is that community-written notes will be visible directly on Tweets, available to everyone on Twitter.</p>\n<p>Currently, Birdwatch is in pilot mode for people in the US. We’re building it in the open, with the public’s input, and we’re taking significant steps to make Birdwatch transparent.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 25, 2021","path":"/blog/birdwatch","title":"Twitter Birdwatch","topics":["product design"],"subtitle":"A community-driven solution to misleading information","problem":"The spread of online misinformation is too large to tackle with centralized tools.","solution":"Empower users to add and moderate context around misleading Tweets.","impact":"Currently in pilot mode, results will be shared publicly as we iterate.","color":"#6BC4FB","where":null,"learn_more":null,"learnings":null,"team":["Twitter Inc"],"myrole":"Design Lead","link":"http://twitter.github.io/birdwatch","link_label":"Birdwatch Guide","cover_image":{"publicURL":"/static/019703952192527a6a771128cb2a5faf/birdwatch-hero.png","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.9668508287292817,"src":"/static/019703952192527a6a771128cb2a5faf/73c85/birdwatch-hero.png","srcSet":"/static/019703952192527a6a771128cb2a5faf/d4144/birdwatch-hero.png 175w,\n/static/019703952192527a6a771128cb2a5faf/a5370/birdwatch-hero.png 350w,\n/static/019703952192527a6a771128cb2a5faf/73c85/birdwatch-hero.png 700w,\n/static/019703952192527a6a771128cb2a5faf/4ff95/birdwatch-hero.png 1050w,\n/static/019703952192527a6a771128cb2a5faf/54967/birdwatch-hero.png 1400w,\n/static/019703952192527a6a771128cb2a5faf/2ef01/birdwatch-hero.png 3960w","sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/petal-before-and-after","title":"Everyday quick-wins","subtitle":"A journal of small steps towards simplicity and meaning.","cover":true,"color":"#f7bcbc","cover_image":{"publicURL":"/static/42f39593a7f582ca66cd6d32708a08f8/petal-phone-hero-2.png"}}},"next":null}}}
