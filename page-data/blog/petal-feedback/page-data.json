At Petal, we work very closely with our Operations team to understand the input they get by interacting with users, but we like to think that their time and expertise is much better spent helping people in need than categorizing desired features.</p>\n<p>The second problem is getting feedback that is too generic to be actionable. Here, NPS surveys and App Store reviews are king.\nWhile important for other purposes, they both suffer from the same gap: feedback here tends to be framed as “satisfaction with my experience in general”, and thus less likely to be immediately insightful. Additionally, when submitting this type of review, customers are taken <em>away</em> from the experience of the product, and having to lean on their memory to describe their troubles and suggestions.</p>\n<p>Last, there’s the problem of categorizing and quantifying. User-submitted messages that come via support, App Stores, or NPS are hard to group, parse, and measure. When reading feedback messages come in, it’s easy to overreact to a sequence about a topic that is hot today, while ignoring another that has been coming consistently twice a day, for months.</p>\n<h2>Requirements</h2>\n<p>Observing the pitfalls above, our requirements for our feedback tool were:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Measurable. We want a number that tells us if feature A causes more dissatisfaction than feature B.</li>\n<li>Specific and actionable: We want the ability to learn about specific moments in the user’s journey, specific pages in the app, and features we launch.</li>\n<li>Contextual: we want people to give feedback <em>in the moment</em> they’re interacting with something, not recalling it days or weeks after.</li>\n<li>Passive: we don’t want feedback prompts to interrupt the action someone is trying to perform.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So here’s what we’ve built: a reusable feedback module that we can add to any page or flow in our app. By clicking it, users are able to provide immediate feedback about what they’re trying to do and how they think we could improve it.</p>\n<p>First, users are prompted to submit a 5-scale score, followed by a text field to explain why.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>First of all, we can now look objectively at how our pages and features are being evaluated by our users, and prioritize which ones need more work:</p>\n<p>(Image)</p>\n<p>We’re then able to dig deeper in each one, read the text messages, and better understand what is causing the issues.</p>\n<p>Second, users are now much more likely to provide real, actionable suggestions.</p>\n<p>We went from seeing generic things like this:</p>\n<p>“Zero stars. This app completely sucks.”</p>\n<p>To seeing this many more of these:</p>\n<p>“Hi Petal, blind user here. Sliding the control to confirm this payment is very challenging to me using Voice Over”.</p>\n<p>Or:</p>\n<p>“I love AutoPay, but I wish I could choose the date it is scheduled in instead of the 26th of every month”.</p>\n<p>Third, by deflecting these hundreds of messages from our customer support main inbox, we’ve helped them sort the signal from noise and better focus on servicing customers in real need.</p>\n<p>But here’s the really, really special thing. We’re investing heavily in listening with curiosity, every time we open the feedback inbox, we can feel our user appreciate being heard. Among the many messages that suggest improvements or point out gaps in our product, we also get an overwhelming amount of thankfulness\nfor what how much we’ve evolved so far. <br>\n<br>\nWe’re in this business to build products not only <em>for</em> customers, but <em>together with</em> our customers, and showing vulnerability and openness to feedback is fundamental to creating a long-lasting relationship of mutual trust and accountability to improve the quality of the things we put out in our member’s world.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"February 15, 2020","path":"/blog/petal-feedback","title":"Collecting in-app feedback","topics":["Product Design","Research"],"subtitle":"Listening with real curiosity","problem":"How can we collect feedback that is specific, measurable, and actionable?","solution":"Atomized, measurable feedback entry-points across the entire app.","impact":"Strong inflow of user-centered evidence that served as a base for product roadmapping.","color":"paleturquoise","where":null,"design_team":null,"learn_more":null,"team":null,"cover_image":{"publicURL":"/static/petal-feedback-1c84b2bc9fe1236fdbc66f2604640e69.png","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/1c84b2bc9fe1236fdbc66f2604640e69/54c56/petal-feedback.png","srcSet":"/static/1c84b2bc9fe1236fdbc66f2604640e69/16256/petal-feedback.png 175w,\n/static/1c84b2bc9fe1236fdbc66f2604640e69/73897/petal-feedback.png 350w,\n/static/1c84b2bc9fe1236fdbc66f2604640e69/54c56/petal-feedback.png 700w,\n/static/1c84b2bc9fe1236fdbc66f2604640e69/c0798/petal-feedback.png 1050w,\n/static/1c84b2bc9fe1236fdbc66f2604640e69/cd9a9/petal-feedback.png 1400w,\n/static/1c84b2bc9fe1236fdbc66f2604640e69/155f2/petal-feedback.png 6400w","sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/petal-help-center","title":"Petal Help Center","subtitle":"A quick visual revamp"}},"next":null}}}
