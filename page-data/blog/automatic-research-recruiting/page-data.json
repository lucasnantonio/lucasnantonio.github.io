At Petal, where “listen with curiosity” and “our job is never done” are company values, this is no different.</p>\n<p>In practice, though, scheduling and executing user interviews is messy, time-consuming and can feel like a burden for teams that are used to moving fast. Querying the base, emailing back-and-forth to find the best time, screening, and signing NDA docs with multiple candidates at the same time can easily eat away a good chunk of someone’s calendar.</p>\n<p>When kicking off Petal’s research program, it has been our goal from the start to unblock user interviews by getting rid of the recruiting overhead and make it “just happen”. I partnered with Jack Docal, my marketing colleague and automation wizard, to find a better way.</p>\n<p>Instead of designing a specific research study or topic, for this project our philosophy was “let’s get the users coming, and no matter what we show them, we’ll learn something every week”</p>\n<h2>The workflow</h2>\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 1800px;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 39.583333333333336%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Schedule after a week of recruiting turned on\"\n        title=\"Schedule after a week of recruiting turned on\"\n        src=\"/static/e822a4bd9d1db088b3136b6349916a6b/79a4a/automated-research-workflow.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/e822a4bd9d1db088b3136b6349916a6b/44727/automated-research-workflow.png 450w,\n/static/e822a4bd9d1db088b3136b6349916a6b/fea0e/automated-research-workflow.png 900w,\n/static/e822a4bd9d1db088b3136b6349916a6b/79a4a/automated-research-workflow.png 1800w,\n/static/e822a4bd9d1db088b3136b6349916a6b/b6e30/automated-research-workflow.png 2700w,\n/static/e822a4bd9d1db088b3136b6349916a6b/5c2f7/automated-research-workflow.png 2976w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n<ol>\n<li>NPS survey</li>\n<li>Opt-in</li>\n<li>Screener questions</li>\n<li>NDA and Agreement signing</li>\n<li>Scheduling a time</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The automated workflow uses a mix of tools: Iterate, Zapier, Segment, Google Sheets, and Calendly.</p>\n<p>Everything starts on our NPS survey, sent to members after they’ve been using the card for a while.

Getting this same number with a hands-on recruiting outreach would have taken much longer, and now we have the ability turn it on or off depending on the demand.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps</h2>\n<p>This automated flow, of course, does not cover all the user research bases. It’s biased towards people who have already been using the card; towards people who are comfortable going through our many partners’ tools; and does not help us conduct studies with people in a specific state or journey.</p>\n<p>We’re working on many other initiatives to ensure our teams have the best evidence they can to make user-centered decisions: automated surveys, contextual feedback entry-points in-app, A/B testing frameworks, data democratization, and our internal empathy gauge. Keep tuned to hear more about them all.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"February 15, 2020","path":"/blog/automatic-research-recruiting","title":"Automated Research Recruiting","topics":["research"],"subtitle":"Talking to users every week","problem":"Recruiting users for interviews is time-consuming","solution":"An automated, self-service flow that allows users to schedule time to talk to our product team","impact":"At least one user interview per week with zero recruiting cost.","color":"MistyRose","where":null,"design_team":null,"learn_more":null,"team":null,"cover_image":{"publicURL":"/static/automated-research-9-e9b12255f60dd1be37e17d85da5ca1d5.png","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/e9b12255f60dd1be37e17d85da5ca1d5/54c56/automated-research-9.png","srcSet":"/static/e9b12255f60dd1be37e17d85da5ca1d5/16256/automated-research-9.png 175w,\n/static/e9b12255f60dd1be37e17d85da5ca1d5/73897/automated-research-9.png 350w,\n/static/e9b12255f60dd1be37e17d85da5ca1d5/54c56/automated-research-9.png 700w,\n/static/e9b12255f60dd1be37e17d85da5ca1d5/c0798/automated-research-9.png 1050w,\n/static/e9b12255f60dd1be37e17d85da5ca1d5/cd9a9/automated-research-9.png 1400w,\n/static/e9b12255f60dd1be37e17d85da5ca1d5/155f2/automated-research-9.png 6400w","sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/nubank/nuconta","title":"NuConta","subtitle":"Designing the most downloaded banking app in the world"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/petal-help-center","title":"Petal Help Center","subtitle":"A quick visual revamp"}}}}}
