      "My colleagues at Petal said nice things: “Lucas has helped shepherd so many critical changes which prioritize the Petal customer's experience. He does so with curiosity, willingness to collaborate, clarity and empathy. I think he's also a cultural bar raiser--he role models professional and courteous behavior, and seems to influence others around him to hold themselves to a higher standard as well. Lucas has made a significant impact on the business in a relatively short amount of time, and he should be formally celebrated for his contributions”",
