It's an attempt to look at the design process (analysis & synthesis) from a “mathematical”, or “first-principles” point of view, in order to find solutions outside of the preconceptions a designer might have when solving problems “intuitively”. It's a remarkable idea, but at times the language went over my head and there was a lot of repetition. ",
