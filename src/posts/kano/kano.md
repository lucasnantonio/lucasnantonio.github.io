In the summer of 2014, I got my first job with digital products at Kano Computer, a record-breaking Kickstarter.com startup, as their incredible teams sprinted to ship the first version of Kano.

## Onboarding

A the time I joined, the product was expected to ship in 4 months with a hard-coded custom OS, which wouldn't get an update until the user had been successfully onboarded and connected to WiFi. During this time I helped the team with multiple tasks to ensure that users would be correctly onboarded — and have fun! — in their first experience with the product. I touched everything from usability testing with kids in school, to copywriting, usability heuristic reviews, and UI design.
