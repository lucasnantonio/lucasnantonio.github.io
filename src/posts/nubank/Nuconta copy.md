After successfully releasing NuConta, a unique kind of savings account now with tens of millions of users, we immediately started getting requests from business owners for products that could also solve their pain-points when running their business' finances.

Like in every one of Nubank's new projects, instead of jumping straight into quick ideas, hot-fixing the existing product for business needs, or copying what the competitors we doing in the space, we invested heavily in digging deeper to understand the problem we were dealing with.

A strong team of engineers, a product manager, business developers, and designers was put together to investigate the problem from all angles: legal and technical feasibility, cost, impact, and, on the design side, desirability.

We spent a month on the field interviewing and shadowing more than 40 business owners, from freelancers to brick and mortar managers, to gathering insights and ultimately publish a report of findings that was used to kickoff the development of the business account product.

The research outcome was indispensable for the team to gather empathy for the target customer, stay focused on the right problems and solutions, and reduce the risk of the overall business unit. Because of the report, it became clear that the first product (the one where customers had the biggest pains and or technology was better positioned to help) was indeed a banking account, and not a POS or finance management tool, like we had thought at the beginning of the project.

I left Nubank before the public release of this product, but managed the team of designers and researchers involved in it until the alpha program was live.
