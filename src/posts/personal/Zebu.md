This is the story of the most improbable project I've been involved with in my career, and the one that today I have the most mixed feelings about.

In one end, I'm extremely grateful for having had such a privileged immersive experience in a place I'd never have access to otherwise, and which helped me learn ethnographic methods and ultimately see the world in a different way. In another, I feel not a small amount of regret. Reducing my meat consumption and advocating for it in my circles has been one of my main goals in the recent times, and to have worked on a project that optimizes the meat industry sometimes gives me some goosebumps.

Anyway, at the time, I was a fresh-out-of-school intern taking an opportunity in one of the most important design & research consultancies around, and even though I considered saying no to the project, in my position at the time that would've been foolish.
