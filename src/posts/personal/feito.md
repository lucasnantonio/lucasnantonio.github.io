Feito was a design shop I co-founded and ran for approximately 3 years with some friends. We saw decent success and created a celebrated community around this idea, but as it happens, our indivisual focuses were elsewhere, so we decided to sunset the project. This page is a celebration of the beautiful products we created together in partnership with some of the best Brazilian designers.
