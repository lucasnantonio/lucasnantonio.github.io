# Petal Onboarding 2.0

## Problems

- Low engagement with features that are good for the customer and for the company: - Linked bank accounts - Autopay - Credit score deep dive - Friend referral
- Lack of an existing strategy to announce and engage users with new features.
- Lack of an existing strategy to reengage users with old features they have never tried.

## Hypothesis

- New users don't get enough in-app guidance about the features we offer, which causes engagement to be low.
- Redesigning the onboarding flow so that it helps the user understand and get set up with Petal's main features will drive engagement, retention, and user satisfaction.
- This same solution can be reused to announce new features and reengage users with unknown features.
- The solution might work with or without a dollar incentive for each step we want the user to complete.

## Goals

- Drive engagement with - Bank account linkage - AutoPay - Credit score deep dive - First transaction - Friend referral

## Ideas / Requisites

- A checklist that welcomes users with their next steps - Lives in the dashboard until dismissed - After dismissal, lives in settings - Might come back to dashboard when new features are announced or we need to push a certain behavior.
- Items lead to a modal that introduces each feature before you see them. This modal might have a carousel or not.
- Status completion bar
- Money incentive for each task
- Some actions need others, so they might be "locked"

## Moments

1. New users
2. Users coming back to the list
3. New feature

## Questions

- Is Optimize you experience the best copy? --> "Activate your card" is not really optimizing.
- Is invite a friend on the checklist? Or is it too Petal-serving? - Maybe it's not an item on the list but still appears as a last modal. "You're all done" "Invite friends" "not right now".
- Is credit score on the checklist?
- Should they be able to go back in the list?
- Dots or numbers in circles?
- Is the end state clear enough for people who are waiting for their card? The current green "Got your card --> activate" seems more clear.
- Should the modals be actionable and enforce good defaults (e.g spend planner) or just an image + text + link to the feature?
- Can we recommend a spend planner amount? Why would that be illegal?
