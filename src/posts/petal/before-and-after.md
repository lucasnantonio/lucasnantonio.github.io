topics:
  - Product Design
color: "#f7bcbc"
learnings:
  - Ensuring the engineering team has a quota of design-led tasks every sprint was essential to getting some of this work prioritized.
  - Accessibility is hard and getting it right deserves much more attention and resources than some small teams have.
  - Setting up a robust AB testing program was one most impactful investments we made as a team.

## This is a collection of tactical, small design wins, a sort of journal. <br> Looking for a robust case study? [Try here.](/blog/nubank/nuconta)

| Customer support and usability testing revealed that users had trouble filtering important content that was two clicks away. | By exposing the filter labels, users don't need to guess what's inside the dropdown. [*Engagement increased ~500%.*](https://share.getcloudapp.com/wbu05LEA) |

| Highest point of friction for Petal users is linking their accounts. | By AB testing many hypothesis, we achieved a version that [*converts 117% more*](https://share.getcloudapp.com/p9u7Y00X) than the initial design. |

| Merchants were named with the raw strings we received, and category icons were assigned. | With some quick Regex, we're able to clean up names and display curated logos for +50% of purchases. |

| Our desktop app was left aside for a while, missing some important navigation and styling alignments with the mobile app | Unified design allowed more consistent, accessible experience, shared components and simpler code.  |

|--------- | --------|
| __Before__        |__After ✓__         |
| Initial modals had CTA and dismiss actions too close to each other and taking too much space. Centered rendering also becomes a problem as out phones grow taller and taller. | Better distributed buttons allows for extra actions such as navigation and secondary CTAs and are more ergonomic on tall devices.|

| Quite a few of Petal's initial designs didn't meet color contrast guidelines.   | It's a daily battle towards better legibility! |

|--------- | --------|
| __Before__        |__After ✓__         |
| Thin, light-gray fonts were great to get Petal hyped for its "designer look".  | We banned light fonts and low-contrast text even from legal disclaimers. Going from light to regular goes a long way for legibility.  |

|--------- | --------|
| __Before__        |__After ✓__         |
| As our app grew, our minimalist navigation starter to get too cryptic. Users relied on trial and error to find the desired content.   | Some Information Architecture gymnastics will soon enable us to achieve a much more understandable "home" for your money.  |

|--------- | --------|
| __Before__        |__After ✓__         |
| Our custom on/off indicators had low contrast and weren't considered "clickable" by users  | Using a more common pattern proved successful for user understanding. |

| Our first iteration was a simple table with the raw data we got from the backend  | With time, we added clean brand names, logos, contact and dispute buttons. |
