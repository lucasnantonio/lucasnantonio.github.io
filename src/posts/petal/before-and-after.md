| Customer support and usability testing revealed that users had trouble finding content that was two clicks away. | By exposing the filter labels, users don't need to guess what's inside the dropdown. Discoverability is increased. |

| Merchants were named with the raw strings we received, and category icons were assigned. | With some quick Regex, we're able to clean up names and display curated logos for +50% of purchses. |

| Initial modals had CTA and dismiss actions too close to each other and taking too much space. Centered rendering also becomes a problem as out phones grow taller and taller. | Better distributed buttons allows for extra actions such as navigation and secondary CTAs. Also closer to thumb on tall phones. |

| Quite a few of Petal's initial designs didn't meet color contrast guidelines.   | It's a daily battle towards better legibility! |

| As our app grew, our minimalist navigation starter to get too cryptic. Users relied on trial and error to find the desired content.   | Some Information Architecture gymnastics will soon enable us to achieve a much more understandable "home" for your money.  |

| Our custom on/off indicators had low contrast and weren't considered "clickable" by users  | Using a more common pattern proved successful for user understanding. |
