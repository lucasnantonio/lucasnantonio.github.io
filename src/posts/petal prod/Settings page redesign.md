# Settings Page redesign

## Problem

Petal's app settings controls were very simple to start with, so at the time, the early team decided to design it as a simple stacked list. As new features were implemented and new options added, it quickly became clear that a new, more scalable information architecture model was needed. The list kept growing and it became both visually overwhelming and cognitively confusing for users to find what they were looking for. With big new additions planned ahead, we decided to give the page a redesign.

## Exploration

The main amount of work on this project involved listing out the current and future controls we could foresee and create a "folder" structure with labels and grouping that made sense for the current state, but that also would live longer enough as new features were added.

The iteration cycles were very quick, and with no formal user research setup on the company at the time, I went around the office with different prototypes and a task list to measure each version's "lostness" level with our own employees.

## Phase 1: Set the playing field

For the first release, we took the current tools and grouped them in three different folders.

## Phase 2: Add features

The second step was to use the newly available space to surface three new big features we were working on in parallel:

- Friend Referral program
- Notification Center
- Credit card details

## Phase 3: Cleanup

Based on user testing also conducted with employees, we started seeing a significant amount of user error when handling the controls on the "Card features" page.
