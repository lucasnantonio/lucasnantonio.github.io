# Accounts page redesign

## Problem
One of Petal's biggest value proposition is that members can link their bank accounts to our app in order to get continuous financial insights, credit underwriting, and other offers. It is also true that some users prefer not to link accounts, and instead manually add routing and account numbers just to in order to pay their card statements.
The way we refer to these accounts internally is "linked accounts" and "manually connected accounts". By analyzing various sources of customer feedback and support tickets, it was clear that we could make this distinction clearer in the app. 

## Exploration


## Phase 1: Set the playing field
For the first release, we took the current tools and grouped them in three different folders.

## Phase 2: Add features
The second step was to use the newly available space to surface three new big features we were working on in parallel: 
- Friend Referral program 
- Notification Center
- Credit card details

## Phase 3: Cleanup
Based on user testing also conducted with employees, we started seeing a significant amount of user error when handling the controls on the "Card features" page.
